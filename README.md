# Sakamoto

Sakamoto is a modular Python Discord bot inspired by the *Nichijou* character. It focuses on voice features for small-to-medium communities.

It is a Python rewrite intended to apply stronger modular design than earlier projects.

## Run

See the [setup guide](https://github.com/taichikuji/Sakamoto/wiki/How-to-get-the-bot-working/) and [configuration reference](https://github.com/taichikuji/Sakamoto/wiki/Configuration-Guide#setting-environment-variables) for integration-specific tokens.

### Docker Compose

```bash
export TOKEN='YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN'
./init-docker.sh
```

### Docker image

```bash
docker build -t sakamoto:latest .
docker run -e TOKEN='YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN' sakamoto:latest
```

Prebuilt images are available as `ghcr.io/taichikuji/sakamoto:latest`; they can be used with Kubernetes, though this repository does not provide a Kubernetes manifest.

To enable the built-in updater, uncomment its service and the `discord` service labels in `docker-compose.yml`. `CRON_SCHEDULE` defaults to `0 0 * * *` (daily).

## Develop

```bash
pipenv install --dev
export TOKEN='YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN'
pipenv run python main.py
```

Extensions live in `extensions/`, grouped by responsibility:

- `core/` contains always-on administration such as loading, syncing, and shutdown.
- `audio/`, `moderation/`, `community/`, `integrations/`, and `general/` contain user-facing domains.

See the [contribution guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), [domain context](CONTEXT.md), and [wiki](https://github.com/taichikuji/Sakamoto/wiki/).

### Command analytics

Sakamoto stores UTC daily aggregate command counts so the Discord application owner can review usage with `/analytics`. The report defaults to 30 days and accepts a period from 1 to 90 days.

The analytics table contains only the command's fully qualified name and its successful and failed invocation counts. It does not store user or server history, Discord IDs, command arguments or options, message content, search terms, URLs, IP data, or command error details. Direct-message interactions are ignored. Daily rows are permanently deleted after 90 days.

For audio commands, handled failures such as unmet voice requirements, source-resolution errors, full queues, and immediate playback failures count as failed invocations rather than successful command completions.
